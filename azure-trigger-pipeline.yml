# This pipeline is connected to the GAIA-X4PLC-AAD/portal Github repository, it recognizes code changes on the main branch and have no library access.
# By executing this pipeline, the build-and-deployment pipeline of the portal in azure devops is executed.
# This trigger is necessary because the Repository resource triggers only work for Azure Repos Git repositories in the same organization and when the self repository type is Azure Repos Git.
# They do not work for GitHub or Bitbucket repository resources.
